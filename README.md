# cutebot
 discord selfbot because why not

### Setup
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Monikaya/cutebot.git
$ cd cutebot
```
If you'd like to run with a virtualenv:
```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
$ python3 setup.py
```
Otherwise you can just run:
```bash
$ python3 setup.py
```

After that, you should just be able to run:
```bash
$ python3 main.py
```
If you run into any issues don't hesitate to open an issue!

### Notes
In order to get your "bearer token" for the twitter module you'll need to head over to https://developer.twitter.com and register there.

Pull requests always welcome

If you're having trouble activating the venv on windows try doing activate.ps1 instead of just activate

### TODO
- Just add more features
- Clean up the code a bit
- Organize
